      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Origami SMTP was created when its author could not find a fake SMTP
        client with TLS support.  Later he came to find out that there may
        have been other options out there he just did not find them in time.
        So, long story short, he started Origami SMTP. Development is still
        an ongoing process and the author hopes to add fake authentication
        and better support to the servers generation of MHTML files.</p>
      <p>Origami SMTP is a fake server that supports TLS and the very
        basic SMTP commands.  It can also validate successfully if the
        Origami SMTP Certificate Authority is installed.</p>
