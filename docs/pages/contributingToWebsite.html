    <h1>Contributing to the Website</h1>
    <p>
      Contributing to the website is easy.  Just fork the git repository and
      edit the files in the docs folder of the master branch.  Then send a pull
      request.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a similar note, there are some things that have been done to make
      development a bit easier.  Since GitHub does not support any server-side
      dynamic programming language there is a JavaScript file, site.js, that
      can load partial pieces of a website.  The downside is there is currrently
      no navigation possible using the back and forward buttons, no way to link
      directly to a page on the site, and no history avalible.  We hope to resolve
      this at a later date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some ideas for resolving this issue is to enance the history possibly using
      history.js or using the HTML5 history API.  We are also going to look into
      having a JavaScript file on our partial pages to see if it is the first one
      loaded and if so load the content you would see on the index.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, to use the template function all you have to do is include a div with
      the attribute data-load set to the url you would like to bring in relative
      to the index and that div will be replaced with the contents of the file.
      If you would like to link to an external website you must include the
      atribute data-type set to the value external.
